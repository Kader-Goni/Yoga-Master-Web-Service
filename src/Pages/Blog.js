            Difference between authorization and authentication..?
          </h6>
          <div className="">
          <p> Authentication vs Authorization To reiterate, authentication and authorization are separate steps in the user access provision process. We can use an analogy to demonstrate the differences. Consider a pet sitter who needs to enter the home of a family that is away on vacation. The pet sitter needs: Authentication, such as a key, keycard, or security code to enter the home. If the pet sitter has the correct piece of hardware to unlock the door, the pet sitter can enter the home. Authorization, such as the permissions and restrictions set by the family. The pet sitter has been authorized to access the living room (where the pet's leash is kept) and the kitchen (where the pet's food is stored). Once inside, the pet sitter can enter these rooms but not any other room. In this example, authentication and authorization work together. A pet sitter has the right to enter the house (authentication), and once there, she has access only to certain areas (authorization). </p>
